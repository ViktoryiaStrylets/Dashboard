 A dashboard presents several visualization techniques for high-D data. Visualization techniques are used to analyze the data and 
 detect interesting findings after exploring the visualizations through the interactivity of all techniques.
 My Data set is the sample of homes from the Ames home sale data that includes 2930 property sales from 2006 to 2010 in Ames, Iowa. In order to build a model that would predict the sales prices of the typical home in Ames, Iowa, during 2006 and 2010
 I needed to familiarize with data to detect potential issues that might affect the prediction ability of my model and choose the variables
 that might have great power in forecasting SalePrice of Ames houses.
